A) This project is essentially to develop a file sharing system that allows us to upload and download files 
between peers. The program has about 3 functions, DIR, DOWNLOAD and UPLOAD. It will also show File directories
or files from a users server.

The program is incomplete, so here is what I can show:

B) I wasn't able to develop the system fully, the most I could do was try and get the ui to a desireable place, and set up the server files.

C) There isn't really way to run it properly, the only way to actually run the program is the default way, where you can run it from intellij, or you used the command line commands: javac --module-path %PATH_TO_FX% --add-modules javafx.controls fileSystem.java Server.java ServerThread.java and then java --module-path %PATH_TO_FX% --add-modules javafx.controls fileSystem Server ServerThread

D) There isn't really another resource or library I used while trying to create this program
